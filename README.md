# ECE 3
UCLA ECE 3 - Introduction to Electrical Engineering, taken with Mike Briggs in Spring 2020.
The final project was a TI-RSLK line-following car, programmed in Energia. 
The car uses IR sensors in a PID feedback algorithm, steering the car through any arbitrary path.
In this project, the paths were a straight line and a circular loop.
